    question: `Are you sure this will help me grow?`,
    answer: `We don't guarantee growth, but yeah, it should help you grow. Our videos perform 10x the average it all comes down to content though. For meaningful growth, you have to be creating content that connects with people. If you're unsure how to do that, our team can help!`,

    question: `Can you take my long-form videos and turn it into shorts?`,
    answer: `Yes we can! You can send us long-form video content or even a YouTube link and we'll turn it into high-performing shorts. If you want to be as hands-off as possible, we recommend having one of our writers pick out the juiciest content.`,

    question: `How long does a video take?`,
    answer: `We think of videos in two ways: High-Fi and Low-Fi. High-Fi videos are like the ones you see on the site - they usually take about 48 hours. Low-fi videos are simple captions, b-roll, and light animations - we can make a few of those per day. We'll provide you with a timeline and keep you updated on the progress each step of the way.`,

    question: `Why wouldn’t I just hire my own animator?`,
    answer: `You could but it's a pain in the ass. In our experience, it often doesn’t end well unless you have experience managing freelancers, which is a headache in itself. We remove all the risk by managing the  process and quality checks for you.`,

    question: `Can I cancel if I don’t like it?`,
    answer: `There's no contracts or long-term agreements. You can pause or cancel at anytime. If we have dedicated an animators time and started work on your videos before you decide to cancel, you won't be eligible for a refund.`,
